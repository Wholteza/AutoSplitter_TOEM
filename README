# What is this?

This is an AutoSplitter for [TOEM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM/) on Steam, a game created by [Something We Made](https://www.somethingwemade.se/). This project started as an idea by the speedrunning community on the [TOEM Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UwxJNqD).
